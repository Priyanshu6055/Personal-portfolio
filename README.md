ðŸ’» Old Personal Portfolio Website

This was my earlier personal website, built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for the frontend, providing a clean and responsive layout with smooth user interaction. 
The backend was developed using Node.js, enabling basic server-side functionality such as handling contact form submissions. This project helped me strengthen my foundational web development skills and gave me hands-on experience in building and deploying a full-stack website from scratch.
